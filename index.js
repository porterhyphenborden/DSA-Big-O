//1. What is the Big O for this?
    //1. O(1)
    //2. O(n)
//2. Even or odd
    //O(1) - This function takes one value as a parameter, and performs one operation on it.
//3. Are you here?
    //O(n^2) - This function has 2 levels of loops.
//4. Doubler
    //O(n) - This function performs an operation on each item in an array, thus the time to complete the function is directly proportional to the number of items in the array.
//5. Naive search
    //O(n) - This function looks at each item in an array (in the worst case), so O is dependent on the length of the array.
//6. Creating pairs
    //O(n^2) - This function has 2 levels of loops.
//7. Compute the sequence
    //Creates the fibonacci sequence up to (num) places. This has an O(n)--the time it takes to complete depends on the value of the num parameter.
//8. An efficient search
    //O(log(n)) - This function cuts the array in half each time it loops through.
//9. Random element
    //O(1) - This function returns a single element, no matter the size of the array.
//10. What Am I?
    //This algorithm determines if a number is prime.  It has O(n)--the larger the number, the longer it could take to determine.
